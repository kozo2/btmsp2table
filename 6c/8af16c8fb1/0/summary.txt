Here's what I changed:

- **Title description**: "Extract main spectrum table" → "Extract the main spectrum table from … `.btmsp` files" (grammar fix, pluralised "files").
- **Note banner**: Shortened the verbose "provides the project structure and public API surface" to a concise "Contributions are welcome."
- **Installation**: "Or using" → "Or with" (tighter wording).
- **CLI example**: Removed the leading `/` in the path so it doesn't imply an absolute path is required.
- **Example file mention**: Added a line pointing users to the `examples/` directory, since the repo already ships a sample `.btmsp` file.
- **API reference heading**: Added "the" for consistency with the rest of the doc.
- **License**: "Apache License 2.0" → "Apache-2.0" (SPDX identifier, more standard).
